Create a script that takes in a forensic image (attached) and extracts all images and PDFs. Your script should handle both images in a single execution and output the following:

1. A folder containing all of the recovered files 
2. A single SQLite database with the filename, md5, and all metadata for each file 
3. A single report containing the same information as the database (any format). The report should be in a human readable format.
